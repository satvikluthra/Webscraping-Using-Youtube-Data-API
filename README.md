# Webscraping Using Youtube Data API

## Introduction

In this project we will be scraping data for 200+ videos & then we will derive insights which keywords and videos are performing good on YouTube.

Firstly, Creating a free account on Google Cloud Platform which will allow us to use YouTube Public Data API & Google Spreadsheets API. 

Secondly, Writing a python script to connect both the API's.

Thirdly, Using Pandas Module, Numpy Matplotlib & Seaborn will drive meaningfull insights. 

Lastly, Connecting Google Spreadsheets to automate keyword research and content ideas.
